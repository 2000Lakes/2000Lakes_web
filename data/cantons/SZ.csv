The lake is surrounded by the mountains Gross Aubrig, Fluebrig, Zindlenspitz, Brünnelistock and Bockmattli. The reservoir is located in the municipality of Innerthal.The old village of Innerthal was flooded in 1924 when the dam Schräh was constructed. A new village was built on the current lake.The primary economical purpose of the Wägitalersee is to serve as reservoir for pumped-storage hydroelectricity. The power plant and the reservoir dam became operational in 1924, thereby creating the Wägitalersee. The power plant is operated by NOK Wägital / AG Kraftwerk Wägital and produces approximately 120 million kWh of energy per year.Besides the above industrial purpose, the lake is very popular as a (nearby) recreational area for families, hikers, nature lovers and especially fishermen. The waterside is easily accessible on foot and also by car (in certain areas).",artificial lake,,,65 m (213 ft),,,,,,,,

The lake was created by damming the river Sihl and flooding a section of the upper Sihl Valley.The lake feeds the Etzelwerk power station, which is located 5 kilometres (3 mi) to the north-east in Altendorf on the upper section of Lake Zürich (the Obersee) and which supplies electricity to the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). Its concrete dam is 33 metres (108 ft) high and 124 metres (407 ft) m long. The lake is the largest artificial lake of Switzerland in terms of surface with a maximum length of 8.5 kilometres (5 mi) and maximum width of 2.5 kilometres (2 mi). The maximum depth is 17 metres (56 ft), and the lake has an approximate volume of 96,000,000 m3 (3.4×109 cu ft).The power plant project started in 1932. A concrete dam and two viaducts over the lake were built before 1937 when the valley was flooded. As a result 107 farms disappeared completely and 1762 persons had to leave their homes.A failure of the dam could lead, according to studies, to an 8-metre (26 ft) high flood wave through the lower Sihl Valley reaching the Altstadt of the city of Zürich, the biggest city in Switzerland, within 2 hours. This threat has led the City of Zürich to develop, publish and test evacuation plans for the affected areas of the city, and especially the area around Zürich Hauptbahnhof railway station.Sihlsee with Fluebrig behindThe northern shore",reservoir,8.5 kilometres (5 mi),2.5 kilometres (2 mi),17 metres (56 ft),"96 million cubic metres (78,000 acre⋅ft)",,,,,,,
