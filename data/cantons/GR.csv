It has an elevation of 2,234 m (7,329 ft), a length of 2.85 km (1.77 mi), a surface area of 1.50 km2 (0.58 sq mi) and a maximum depth of 53 m (174 ft). Once the site of two smaller lakes (Lago Bianco and Lago della Scala), the current reservoir was formed by the constructions of two dams (Scala and Arlas) at its southern and northern ends. The current lake drains to the south, as did both its precursor lakes, with its water eventually reaching the Mediterranean via the rivers Poschiavino, Adda and Po. By contrast, Lej Nair, just below the northern dam. drains north into the Black Sea via the rivers Inn and Danube.The summit of the Bernina railway line, which is the highest mountain crossing railway in Europe, runs alongside the eastern side of the lake, with the Ospizio Bernina station at roughly the mid-point. The road across the Bernina pass (Hauptstrasse 29) follows a higher route on the same side of the lake. Most of the lake lies within the municipality of Poschiavo, although the most northerly section and the northern dam lie within the municipality of Pontresina.The Lago Bianco reservoir was created between 1910 and 1911 in order to provide a constant supply of water to a series of hydro-electric power plants in the Val Poschiavo. It has a maximum volume of 18.6 million cubic metres (15,100 acre⋅ft). Initially water was discharged into natural watercourses as far as a power station intake at Cavaglia that fed the Robbia power station  at San Carlo. However, in 1927 two power stations were built between the lake and Cavaglia. The highest of these, the Palü power station  at Lago Palü, is now fed by a pipeline from the southern end of the reservoir.There are current proposals to construct a pumped storage scheme based on Lago Bianco and the Lago di Poschiavo some 1,270 metres (4,170 ft) below.  This would involve creating a 18.1 kilometres (11.2 mi) long tunnel high along the western side of the Val di Poschiavo, followed by 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi) long shaft to an underground power plant on the banks of the Lago di Poschiavo. This would have a total installed capacity of 1000 MW and would consume electricity to pump water to the higher level at times of low demand and release water to generate electricity in times of high demand. The scheme would involve raising the dams at either end of Lago Bianco by 4.35 metres (14.3 ft). The proposals have received formal consent from the cantonal authorities, but as of 2016 are not believed to be financially viable.The shoreline of the lakeView of Lago Bianco from the Diavolezza cable carNorth (Arlas) damSouth (Scala) damThe Bernina line alongside the lake",reservoir,,,53 m (174 ft),"18.6 million cubic metres (15,100 acre⋅ft)",,,,,,,,,

It is one of the lakes on the Flims Rockslide deposits. The lake is fed from underground sources. Its surface area is 10.3194 ha.The level of the lake varies by approximately 4 to 5 meters along with the varying underground water flow during the year, hence reaches its minimum by the end of April when snow melting in the mountains increases. A maximum level is reached by mid July but may be topped in August even after previous falling due to summer rain. The very western bay never freezes in winter, probably showing a maximum water flow in this area.When the lake is at a low level, with a small volume of water, it warms up sooner than most lakes in the region, so people can be seen starting to swim the lake in April while bigger lakes even in lower areas of Switzerland remain rather cool. Water temperature in summer is at an average 21 Celsius, with a maximum around 24 Celsius.The lake is in a huge forest that was allowed to remain on the agriculturally useless debris area of the biggest prehistoric rockslide in the Alps and can only be reached by a footpath (wheelchair accessible), possibly using a funicular built in 1939, refurbished in 1988 on its original tracks (running May to October only). The walk from the edge of town to the funicular takes about 10 minutes.As close as 500 yards to the Caumasee is another dell and altering lake, called Lag Tuleritg, which is just about level to the Caumasee; it is just 18 meters higher. This lake dries out completely in autumn and remains empty until being filled by a small river of just about 800m in length, covering some 100 meters difference in altitude. That river will start flowing around May, depending on temperatures and snow melt rate in the mountains. Its origin is another lake, Lag Prau Pulté, which is fed by underground water only in spring, disappearing in autumn and staying dry all winter. During a cold period in spring, water that entered the basin of this lake may disappear again as snow melt decreases and all water remains in the underground flow. Due to its origin, the water of both lakes is grey all summer until the level starts to go down in autumn. In Lag Prau Pulte one can see another special effect caused by air being forced out of the underground; this is causing the lake not only to remain grey but to frequently produce bubbles and therefore different colours can be seen on the surface.The flow system has been severely attacked by building the Flims Bypass Tunnel when engineers decided to divert some 800 Litres per minute of underground water flow out of the tunnel instead of sealing it into the rock. Further changes occurred when another previously existing basin near the road, which filled with water every year, was landfilled during road constructions. Since 2011 additional water is being fed near the tunnel into the river running from Lag Prau Pulte to Lag Tuleritg to compensate the water loss in the underground system.A fourth lake, Crestasee, is also fed by underground water but retains a constant level all year.low water level in April 2007Funicular from FlimsCaumasee eastern bay in autumnFrozen lake in February",,597m,313m,30 m (98 ft),650 thousand cubic metres (23×10^6 cu ft),,,,,,,,,

It has an elevation is 962 m (3,156 ft), a length of 2.5 km (1.6 mi), a surface area of 1.98 km2 (0.76 sq mi) and a maximum depth of 85 m (279 ft). The lake is both fed and drained by the Poschiavino river and drains to the south, with its water eventually reaching the Mediterranean via the rivers Adda and Po.The lake lies within the municipality of Poschiavo, and the villages of Le Prese and Miralago lie at its northern and southern ends respectively. The Bernina railway line runs alongside the western side of the lake, with stations at Le Prese and Miralago. The main valley road (Hauptstrasse 29) follows a higher route on the same side of the lake. A level hiking trail circumnavigates the lake, with some sections on the more precipitous eastern side in tunnel.The lake was first referred to in 1010, when the newly founded monastery of San Abbondio in Como was granted fishing rights on the lake. By 1239 the fishing rights belonged to the Lords of Matsch .Between 1904 and 1907 the lake was converted into a reservoir as part of a series of hydro-electric power plants in the Val di Poschiavo that are fed from the Lago Bianco. Water arriving at the lake in the Poschiavino river has already passed through several plants, and water leaving the lake passes along a tunnel high along the western side of the valley and then down a pipeline to feed the Campocologno power station  at Campocologno. The conversion to a reservoir involved constructing a dam at the lakes outfall at Miralago that raised the maximum level of the lake by 1 m (3 ft 3 in). In operation the level of water can vary by up to 7 m (23 ft), giving a usable storage capacity of 15.1 million cubic metres (12,200 acre⋅ft). The total capacity of the lake when full is 111.1 million cubic metres (90,100 acre⋅ft).There are current proposals to construct a pumped storage scheme based on Lago di Poschiavo and Lago Bianco, which is some 1,270 metres (4,170 ft) higher. This would involve creating a 18.1 kilometres (11.2 mi) long tunnel high along the western side of the Val di Poschiavo from Lago Bianco, followed by 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi) long shaft to an underground power plant on the banks of the Lago di Poschiavo. This would have a total installed capacity of 1000 MW and would consume electricity to pump water to the higher level at times of low demand and release water to generate electricity in times of high demand. The proposals have received formal consent from the cantonal authorities, but as of 2016 are not believed to be financially viable.",natural lake,2.5 km (1.6 mi),,85 m (279 ft),"111.1 million cubic metres (90,100 acre⋅ft)",,,,,,,,,

From 1892 a guest house on its northern end served as pension and still is a restaurant today in its original state.There is no tributary to the lake. The rough character of the whole area derives from being a debris area of the gigantic Flims Rockslide, where waters flow underground until feeding lakes at certain spots such as Crestasee, Caumasee or Lag Prau Pulté.Less than 100 yards (91 m) from its northern end a gorge called ""Felsbachschlucht"" is formed by river Flem, coming from Flims, whose Romansh name is also Flem. The waters from the lake and river are independent, and of course the river had only some 10 000 years to create the gorge as this is the age of the rockslide.The water from the lake forms a small stream and enters the Flem river after a very short run, not called a special name for its short length.In summer it is well known for swimming and offers facilities (such as a kiosk, toilets, changing room, boats and SUP's to rent) to enjoy this. An entrance charge will be collected by an employee of the restaurant, walking around the lake once or twice a day. Crestasee can be reached from Flims via the Felsbachschlucht gorge or wide forest paths, as well as from Trin Mulin or the public post car stop Felsbach/Crestasee on the main road, to where it is connected by a nice and short path.

The water in the reservoir is used for energy production further downstream in the power plants Sils and Rothenbrunnen. This dam is used as daily storage. Because of the small size of the lake compared with its catchment area sediment aggregation plays an important role.
