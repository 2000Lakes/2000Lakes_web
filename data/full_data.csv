At 285 m (935 ft) high, it is the tallest gravity dam in the world, fifth tallest dam overall, and the tallest dam in Europe. It is part of the Cleuson-Dixence Complex. With the primary purpose of hydroelectric power generation, the dam fuels four power stations, totaling the installed capacity to 2,069 MW, generating approximately 2,000 GWh annually, enough to power 400,000 Swiss households.The dam withholds Lac des Dix (Lake Dix), its reservoir. With a surface area of 4 km², it is the second largest lake in Valais and the largest lake above 2,000 m in the Alps. The reservoir receives its water from four different pumping stations; the Z’Mutt, Stafel, Ferpècle and Arolla. At peak capacity, it contains approximately 400,000,000 m3 (1.4×1010 cu ft) of water, with depths reaching up to 284 m (932 ft). Construction on the dam began in 1950 and was completed in 1961, before officially commissioning in 1965.In 1922, Energie Ouest Suisse (EOS) became established with a few small power stations. To generate substantial amounts of electricity, EOS looked to the Valais canton which contains 56% of Switzerland's glaciers and stores the largest amount of water in Europe. In 1927, EOS acquired the license for the upper Dixence basin. In 1929, 1,200 workers constructed the first Dixence dam which would be complete in 1935. The first dam would supply water to the Chandoline Power Station which has a capacity of 120 MW.After the Second World War, growing industries needed electricity and construction on the Cleuson Dam began in 1947 and was completed in 1951. The original Dixence dam was submerged by the filling of Lac des Dix beginning in 1957, it can still be seen when the reservoir level is low.Plans for the Super Dixence Dam were now being finalized by the recently founded company, Grande Dixence SA. Construction on the Super Dixence Dam soon began later in 1950. By 1961, 3,000 workers had finished pouring 6,000,000 m3 (210,000,000 cu ft) of concrete, completing the dam. At 285 m, it was the world's tallest dam at the time, but it was surpassed by the Nurek Dam of Tajikistan in 1972 (300 m). It remains the world's tallest gravity dam.In the 1980s, Grande Dixence SA and EOS began the Cleuson-Dixence project which improved the quality of electricity produced by building new tunnels along with the Bieudron Power Station. By the time the Cleuson-Dixence Complex was complete, the power generated had more than doubled.The construction of the dam was documented in the short film Opération béton, the first film directed by Jean-Luc Godard.The Grande Dixence Dam is a 285 m (935 ft) high, 700 m (2,297 ft) long concrete gravity dam. The dam is 200 m (656 ft) wide at its base and 15 m (49 ft) wide at its crest. The dam's crest reaches an altitude of 2,365 m (7,759 ft). The dam structure contains approximately 6,000,000 m3 (211,888,000 cu ft) of concrete. To secure the dam to the surrounding foundation, a grout curtain surrounds the dam, reaching a depth of 200 m (656 ft) and extending 100 m (328 ft) on each side of the valley.Although the dam is situated on the relatively small Dixence, water supplied from other rivers and streams is pumped by the Z’Mutt, Stafel, Ferpècle and Arolla pumping stations. The pumping stations transport the water through 100 km (62 mi) of tunnels into its reservoir, Lac des Dix. Water from the 87 m (285 ft) high Cleuson Dam, located 7 km (4 mi) to the northwest, is also transported from its reservoir, the Lac de Cleuson. Three penstocks transport water from Lac des Dix to the Chandoline, Fionnay, Nendaz and Bieudron power stations, before being discharged into the Rhône below. All the pumping stations, power stations and dams form the Cleuson-Dixence Complex. Although the complex operates with water being pumped from one reservoir to another, it does not technically qualify as a pumped-storage scheme.Most of the water comes from glaciers when they melt during the summer. The lake is usually at full capacity by late September, and empties during the winter, eventually reaching its lowest point around April.The Chandoline Power Station was the power station for the original Dixence Dam. The Grande Dixence Dam submerged the original dam but the power station still operates with water received from the reservoir of the Grande Dixence Dam, Lac des Dix. The power station is the smallest of the four, producing 120 MW from five Pelton turbines with a gross head of 1,748 m (5,735 ft).The Fionnay Power Station receives water from the Grande Dixence Dam by a 9 km (6 mi) long tunnel with an average gradient of 10%. Once the tunnel reaches a surge chamber at Louvie in Bagnes, it turns into a penstock which descends at a gradient of 73% for 800 m (2,625 ft) until it reaches the power station. The water, now flowing at a maximum rate of 45 m3/s (1,589 cu ft/s) spins six Pelton turbines, generating a combined maximum capacity of 290 MW.After arriving at the Fionnay Power Station from the Grande Dixence Dam, water then travels through a 16 km (10 mi) pressure tunnel which eventually leads into the Péroua surge chamber, 1,000 m (3,281 ft) above the Nendaz Power Station. The water, which remains at a maximum rate of 45 m3/s (1,589 cu ft/s) spins six Pelton turbines, generating a combined maximum capacity of 390 MW.The Nendaz power station is located within mountains between Aproz and Riddes and is the second-largest hydroelectric power station in Switzerland after the Bieudron Power Station.The water travels down a long penstock from the Grande Dixence Dam before reaching the Bieudron Power Station 1,883 m (6,178 ft) down. The water spins three pelton turbines, generating a combined capacity of 1,269 MW. The power station was constructed after the Nendaz and Fionnay power stations. The power station was built by both Grande Dixence SA and Energie Ouest Suisse between 1993 and 1998 at a cost of US$1.2 billion.The Bieudron Power Station alone holds three world records, for the height of its head (1,883 m (6,178 ft)), the output of each Pelton turbine (3 × 423 MW) and the output per pole of the generators (35.7 MVA). It was taken out of service in December 2000 after the rupture of a penstock. The power station became partially operational in December 2009 and fully operational in 2010.",Gravity dam,,,,,,,,,,,

Once the site of two smaller lakes (Lago Bianco and Lago della Scala), the current reservoir was formed by the constructions of two dams (Scala and Arlas) at its southern and northern ends. The current lake drains to the south, as did both its precursor lakes, with its water eventually reaching the Mediterranean via the rivers Poschiavino, Adda and Po. By contrast, Lej Nair, just below the northern dam. drains north into the Black Sea via the rivers Inn and Danube.The summit of the Bernina railway line, which is the highest mountain crossing railway in Europe, runs alongside the eastern side of the lake, with the Ospizio Bernina station at roughly the mid-point. The road across the Bernina pass (Hauptstrasse 29) follows a higher route on the same side of the lake. Most of the lake lies within the municipality of Poschiavo, although the most northerly section and the northern dam lie within the municipality of Pontresina.The Lago Bianco reservoir was created between 1910 and 1911 in order to provide a constant supply of water to a series of hydro-electric power plants in the Val Poschiavo. It has a maximum volume of 18.6 million cubic metres (15,100 acre⋅ft). Initially water was discharged into natural watercourses as far as a power station intake at Cavaglia that fed the Robbia power station  at San Carlo. However, in 1927 two power stations were built between the lake and Cavaglia. The highest of these, the Palü power station  at Lago Palü, is now fed by a pipeline from the southern end of the reservoir.There are current proposals to construct a pumped storage scheme based on Lago Bianco and the Lago di Poschiavo some 1,270 metres (4,170 ft) below.  This would involve creating a 18.1 kilometres (11.2 mi) long tunnel high along the western side of the Val di Poschiavo, followed by 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi) long shaft to an underground power plant on the banks of the Lago di Poschiavo. This would have a total installed capacity of 1000 MW and would consume electricity to pump water to the higher level at times of low demand and release water to generate electricity in times of high demand. The scheme would involve raising the dams at either end of Lago Bianco by 4.35 metres (14.3 ft).

As one of a few meromictic lakes in Europe, it is the object of numerous scientific studies. The Piora valley - located in the Saint-Gotthard Massif (central Swiss Alps) in the Southern part of Switzerland near Airolo at an altitude of 1921 m above sea level - is a landlocked alpine valley whose scientific value has been recognized for more than two centuries. In the past, the lake was used as a reservoir.Lake Cadagno is a rare example of crenogenic meromixis. Its waters show a permanent stratification due to a natural geological phenomenon. The lower abounds with dissolved mineral salts (sulphate, magnesium, calcium, carbonate) originating from sublacustrine springs, whereas the separate upper layer is permanently oxygenated. Anaerobic phototrophic bacteria – among them Chromatium okenii—thrive between the two layers where they find the ideal conditions for their development. Such an ecosystem provides a good opportunity to study the metabolisms connected with eutrophication on a stable model, as it is well known that one of the advanced stages of eutrophication is biogenic meromixis.For the last 25 years the area has been increasingly used for scientific purposes, both for teaching and researching various environmental subjects. In view of stimulating educational and scientific activities at a university level, the Alpine Biology Center (ABC) has been set up by the Canton of Ticino, in cooperation with the universities of Geneva and Zurich. For this purpose, two 16th century buildings of the Alpe Piora have been turned into a laboratory and lodgings. The Microbiology Institute of the canton of Ticino is responsible both for managing the center and coordinating its activities.Cyclobotryococcatriene, a botryococcene-related hydrocarbon, was isolated from and identified in organic-rich sediments in Lake Cadagno in 2000.Tonolla M, Storelli N, Danza F, Ravasi D, Peduzzi S, Posth NR, et al.

Steering is very difficult complicating the race significantly requiring great strength and skill on behalf of the athletes. The skier with the most points after the three races on consecutive Sundays is crowned the ""King of the Engadin Valley"". In addition to skijoring, traditional flat and trotting races over different distances are held. Until recently visitor parking was also located on the lake, but this practice has since been prohibited.The first cricket tournament on the frozen lake took place in 1990.

Its surface area is 11.8 ha (29 acres). The lake is located above the village of Erlenbach im Simmental, below Stockhorn.During the 19th and 20th centuries, the ""Oberstockensee"" was often called the Vorderstockensee and/or Spetbaerglisee. Local residents still refer to it as the ""Spetbaerglisee.""  Vorderstocken and Spetbaergli are the two alpine meadows that are on opposite sides of the lake.Five people drowned in the ""Oberstockensee"" in a tragic accident on Sunday, 1 August 1869 (the Swiss national ""Independence Day"" holiday) on Mt. Stockhorn: • Johann Gottfried Batzli (1830-1869), the president of the Erlenbach im Simmental Community Council, who only shortly before had been the miller and baker at the lower mill on the ""Wildenbach"" creek in the village and was long remembered because of his winning personality and his friendly, gentle voice • Johannes Batzli (1862-1869), the seven-year-old orphaned son of a first cousin of the community council president • Rudolf Jutzeler (1853-1869), a sixteen-year-old godson of Susanna Katharina Buehler Zurbruegg (1800-1859), the mother-in-law of Johann Gottfried Batzli• David Sulzener Jr. (1851-1869), an eighteen-year-old hired hand working for the Batzli brothers on the ""Hinterstocken"" alpine pasture• Samuel Tschabold (1853-1869), the sixteen-year-old son of Jakob Tschabold Jr. (b. 1806), who had been working with his father on the ""Spetbaergli"" alpine pasture.Although hardly any specific details are known that caused the deathly course of events, oral history reports agree that the little boat set out on the east side of the lake below the ""Oberstocken"" alpine pasture heading for the herdsmen′s little hut on the ""Spetbaergli"" pastures on the west side of the lake.Susanna Katharina Zurbruegg Batzli (1829-1901), who had been with her husband on the ""Hinterstocken"" alpine pasture chose not to accompany the men in their little boat. Picking wild flowers as she walked along the rocky narrow pathway (locally known as ""the evil footpath""), she even heard her husband call to her that it was a pity that she had not joined them on the lovely boat-ride.Not long thereafter, the community council president′s wife saw the overturned boat and young Johannes′ straw hat on the little lake only a short distance from their destination. Those sparse facts support the presumption that the boy′s hat had fallen into the water. When he leaned over the edge of the boat to try and fetch his hat, some of the men tried to deter him. The boat lost its equilibrium and quickly overturned. That assumption seemed valid, particularly when amended with the fact that five persons simply overloaded such a small rowing boat.Upon learning of the tragedy, Erlenbach Pastor Ludwig Wilhelm Bernhard Huerner (1827-1903) and village schoolmaster  Saegesser immediately hiked up the mountain to the site of the accident. On Monday gunsmith Johann Jakob Rieder II (1823-1875) joined with them to dredge the lake in search of the bodies. While Huerner and Saegesser rowed the boat, Rieder handled the long rope to which a three-pronged hook resembling a small anchor was attached. It was a taxing ordeal for the three of them as they went back and forth over the area which Jakob Tschabold pointed out as being the actual scene of the accident. After a lengthy search, they found one corpse and then another, until the last body was finally recovered on Thursday.On Saturday, 7 August 1869, the Reverend Huerner presided over the moving funeral service in Erlenbach i.S. for the five persons. The pastor personally chiseled the five names on the commemorative gravestone near the entrance of the Erlenbach churchyard.The name of Adele Batzli (1898-1999) – a grandniece of Erlenbach Community Council president Johann Gottfried Batzli – appears at the bottom of the gravestone below the names of the five persons who drowned. She donated money to keep up the grave in the churchyard and was therefore allowed to also be buried there and have her name added to the marker.The surnames Batzli and Jutzeler were spelled on the commemorative gravestone without the letter ""t"" in their names, a variation typical of the local Bernese dialect in the Simmental valley. However, two distinct errors remain inexplicable:• The seven-year-old boy who drowned was named Johannes Batzli and not Johann Friedrich (""Joh. Frd. "") as chiseled on the gravestone. Johann Friedrich Batzli Sr., referenced above as ""a first cousin of the community council president,"" was the father of the boy. Little Johannes′ elder brother was Johann Friedrich Batzli Jr. (b. 1860). In the Daerstetten Citizens′ Registers he is recorded as having renounced his Swiss citizenship upon becoming naturalized in ""Jefferson"" in the USA in 1892.• According to the Daerstetten Christening Register (1843–75), Rudolf Jutzeler′s correct date of birth is 29 March 1853.",natural,,,15.3 m (50 ft),,,,,,,,

It is one of the lakes on the Flims Rockslide deposits. The lake is fed from underground sources. Its surface area is 10.3194 ha.The level of the lake varies by approximately 4 to 5 meters along with the varying underground water flow during the year, hence reaches its minimum by the end of April when snow melting in the mountains increases. A maximum level is reached by mid July but may be topped in August even after previous falling due to summer rain. The very western bay never freezes in winter, probably showing a maximum water flow in this area.When the lake is at a low level, with a small volume of water, it warms up sooner than most lakes in the region, so people can be seen starting to swim the lake in April while bigger lakes even in lower areas of Switzerland remain rather cool. Water temperature in summer is at an average 21 Celsius, with a maximum around 24 Celsius.The lake is in a huge forest that was allowed to remain on the agriculturally useless debris area of the biggest prehistoric rockslide in the Alps and can only be reached by a footpath (wheelchair accessible), possibly using a funicular built in 1939, refurbished in 1988 on its original tracks (running May to October only). The walk from the edge of town to the funicular takes about 10 minutes.As close as 500 yards to the Caumasee is another dell and altering lake, called Lag Tuleritg, which is just about level to the Caumasee; it is just 18 meters higher. This lake dries out completely in autumn and remains empty until being filled by a small river of just about 800m in length, covering some 100 meters difference in altitude. That river will start flowing around May, depending on temperatures and snow melt rate in the mountains. Its origin is another lake, Lag Prau Pulté, which is fed by underground water only in spring, disappearing in autumn and staying dry all winter. During a cold period in spring, water that entered the basin of this lake may disappear again as snow melt decreases and all water remains in the underground flow. Due to its origin, the water of both lakes is grey all summer until the level starts to go down in autumn. In Lag Prau Pulte one can see another special effect caused by air being forced out of the underground; this is causing the lake not only to remain grey but to frequently produce bubbles and therefore different colours can be seen on the surface.The flow system has been severely attacked by building the Flims Bypass Tunnel when engineers decided to divert some 800 Litres per minute of underground water flow out of the tunnel instead of sealing it into the rock. Further changes occurred when another previously existing basin near the road, which filled with water every year, was landfilled during road constructions. Since 2011 additional water is being fed near the tunnel into the river running from Lag Prau Pulte to Lag Tuleritg to compensate the water loss in the underground system.A fourth lake, Crestasee, is also fed by underground water but retains a constant level all year.low water level in April 2007Funicular from FlimsCaumasee eastern bay in autumnFrozen lake in February",,,,30 m (98 ft),650 thousand cubic metres (23×10^6 cu ft),,,,,,,

The lake is both fed and drained by the Poschiavino river and drains to the south, with its water eventually reaching the Mediterranean via the rivers Adda and Po.The lake lies within the municipality of Poschiavo, and the villages of Le Prese and Miralago lie at its northern and southern ends respectively. The Bernina railway line runs alongside the western side of the lake, with stations at Le Prese and Miralago. The main valley road (Hauptstrasse 29) follows a higher route on the same side of the lake. A level hiking trail circumnavigates the lake, with some sections on the more precipitous eastern side in tunnel.The lake was first referred to in 1010, when the newly founded monastery of San Abbondio in Como was granted fishing rights on the lake. By 1239 the fishing rights belonged to the Lords of Matsch .Between 1904 and 1907 the lake was converted into a reservoir as part of a series of hydro-electric power plants in the Val di Poschiavo that are fed from the Lago Bianco. Water arriving at the lake in the Poschiavino river has already passed through several plants, and water leaving the lake passes along a tunnel high along the western side of the valley and then down a pipeline to feed the Campocologno power station  at Campocologno. The conversion to a reservoir involved constructing a dam at the lakes outfall at Miralago that raised the maximum level of the lake by 1 m (3 ft 3 in). In operation the level of water can vary by up to 7 m (23 ft), giving a usable storage capacity of 15.1 million cubic metres (12,200 acre⋅ft). The total capacity of the lake when full is 111.1 million cubic metres (90,100 acre⋅ft).There are current proposals to construct a pumped storage scheme based on Lago di Poschiavo and Lago Bianco, which is some 1,270 metres (4,170 ft) higher. This would involve creating a 18.1 kilometres (11.2 mi) long tunnel high along the western side of the Val di Poschiavo from Lago Bianco, followed by 2.4 kilometres (1.5 mi) long shaft to an underground power plant on the banks of the Lago di Poschiavo. This would have a total installed capacity of 1000 MW and would consume electricity to pump water to the higher level at times of low demand and release water to generate electricity in times of high demand.
